## Definition

In probability and statistics, population mean and expected value are used synonymously to refer to one measure of the central tendency either of a probability distribution or of the random variable characterized by that distribution.[^1] In the case of a discrete probability distribution of a random variable $X$, the mean is equal to the sum over every possible value weighted by the probability of that value; that is, it is computed by taking the product of each possible value $x$ of $X$ and its probability $P(x)$, and then adding all these products together, giving  $\mu =\sum xP(x)$.[^2] An analogous formula applies to the case of a continuous probability distribution. Not every probability distribution has a defined mean; see the Cauchy distribution for an example. Moreover, for some distributions the mean is infinite.




$$\begin{aligned}
   \mu &=\sum & xP(x)& \\
   \mu &=\int_{-\infty }^{\infty } & xP(x)& \text{d}x
\end{aligned}$$
